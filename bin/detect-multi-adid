# Detects instances where two rows in Altice or Charter data have the
# same segment name, event date, event time, and network, but they have
# different values for ISCI/ADID.
#
# The point of this was to figure out how often this has happened,
# because in February 2022 we realized that we hadn't included ISCI/ADID
# to determine row uniqueness, and we probably should have.
#
# Expects input as CSV with the first row as headers, and then the
# following columns:
#
#   1. Audience Segment Name
#   2. Event Date
#   3. Event Time
#   4. Network
#   5. ISCI/ADID
#   6. Impressions
